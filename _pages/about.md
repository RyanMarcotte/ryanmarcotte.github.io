## About Ryan Marcotte

I have been working in the software development industry since 2012.  I got my start programming video games as a hobby in 2004 while I was still in high school.  In 2017, [I completed by Masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Regina](https://ourspace.uregina.ca/bitstream/handle/10294/7884/Marcotte_Ryan_200266366_MSC_CS_Fall2017.pdf).  I have been leading a small talented development team at [BrewNinja](https://get.brewninja.net/) as their Chief Technical Officer and Software Development Lead since 2019.  From time to time I make appearances at conferences to share my experience and knowledge gained while solving real business problems.

I play many roles at almost every stage of the software development lifecycle: from "information gatherer", through analyst, modeller, architect, leader, programmer, tester, to maintainer of the system in production.  My passion is creating an environment where a development team can operate at their best.

Outside of work, I maintain a very active lifestyle through weight training and various types of dance.
