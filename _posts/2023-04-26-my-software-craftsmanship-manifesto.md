As an aspiring software craftsman, I am raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others to learn the craft.  Through this work I have come to value:

- Not only working software, but also **well-crafted software**
- Not only responding to change, but also **steadily adding value**
- Not only individuals and interactions, but also **a community of professionals**
- Not only customer collaboration, but also **productive partnerships**

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left I have found the items on the right to be indispensable.

The above text is copied from the [**Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship**](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), which I have signed.

Some of my own personal priorities include:

- **Get feedback [early and often](http://tryqa.com/why-is-early-and-frequent-feedback-in-agile-methodology-important/)** by [leaning on the compiler](https://wellfire.co/this-old-pony/leaning-on-the-compiler-and-working-effectively-with-legacy-django-code--this-old-pony-48/) and by adhering to principles of [*continuous integration*](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html), [*continuous delivery*](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html), and [*continuous architecture*](https://continuousarchitecture.com/)
- **Reduce cognitive load** by [minimizing *accidental complexity*](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/07/01/yes-silver-bullet/)
- [**Eliminate or reduce *toil***](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/) by simplifying and automating development processes
- Proactively develop self-organizing individuals and teams
- Apply principles of [*domain-driven design*](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) as appropriate, especially its strategic patterns: [*bounded contexts*](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html), [*context maps*](https://github.com/ddd-crew/context-mapping), and the [*ubiquitous language*](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html)

To end, **context is king**: there are no silver bullets, only tradeoffs.
